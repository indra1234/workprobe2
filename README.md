# Embedded System & Microcontroller Projects 02:  PC based multiple Sensor Control, Part #1 - Sensor Interfacing with Microcontroller P89VRD2BN/PIC18F45801.

## 02.1 Project Description:
- Project Name : Sensor Interfacing with Microcontroller P89VRD2BN/PIC18F458.
- Skill: Sensor interfacing like Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, Proximity etc, programming used Embedded C, Hardware design Multisim, PCB design in Ultiboard, Microcontroller used PIC18F458/P89Vrd2BN.
- Application  : In Industry, Biomedical, Automation industry, Aerospace etc. 
- Result : Completed
- Actually when I do the work then I faced some problems and that’s are first of all sensor value or calibration which is very important for contr0l any type of machine, because that is backbone of machine means of sensor not detect or you don't set the sensor then machine not working properly. Here I used light sensor so light effect is the problem means always change the value of sensor on the light effects. Second milestone is PCB or printed circuit board, the value of bread board and value of PCB both are quite different when I was doing this work.  
So, that’s the challenge for me and I was overcome this problem after lot of hard work.
This is the microcontroller based project where I just interfaced sensors with P89VRD2BN/PIC18F458 microcontroller. In here I used two optical or light sensors, microcontroller and motor. The main object of this project is control the motor speed or motion with respect to sensor value. Its applications in everywhere just like as in Automation industry, Aerospace and Biomedical industry. In here I just used two optical sensors for control the A.C or D.C motors. The main skills used Embedded system, programming in c and Analogy & Digital Circuit in Multisim.

# 02 PC based multiple Sensor Control, Part #2 – The Control Software running on standard Desktop PCs.

Project Name : PC Based Multiple sensor controlled.
Skill : Analog & Digital hardware Design, PCB design, Programming in Embedded C, Testing.
Software : Keil, Micro pro PIC, Multisim, NI LabView.
Application : In industry, widely used in Biomedical & automobile industry etc
Result: Completed
- Previous project is useful but needed automation means needed computer based control. So just improved this project using PC and control the system or machine by computer. So, here I used RS232/USB to Serial converter, NI Lab View and others hardware’s are same. NI Lab View is useful software for connecting and detect external hardware to your PC. Here RS232 used for connect to hardware with your PC. The application is automation, biomedical and aerospace etc. In here I used Lab View for control the system or machine and automation means show the output graphically of the system.
